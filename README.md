## Hi there, I am Alexandre Vaz.

### A bit about me
Bourn in 1983, in S√£o Paulo (Brazil). Currently residing in Curitiba, Paran√° (Brazil).

1999 was the year I had my first encouter with the idea of what was DHTML and how to use it. Love at first sight, ye know [wink]

I work with programming since 2004, at first with web languages, mostly php and javascript, then in 2007 added to my repertoire Firebird SQL and Fastscript. Nowadays I dabble with Python, NodeJs and PostgreSQL.

Most of my experience came from my contact with nonprofit organizations, which gave me an artistic view of technology and computing.

I'm a self-taught person, always avid and ready to learn. As a dedicated worker, I'm diligent with my activities and place. A tad idiosyncratic, yet not deprived of charisma and amiability.
Learned english mostly by myself, but had a bit of help of a lot of dear people I've met along the years. Not good enough to to boldly declare that I can efficiently write or speak, but but I'm confident with read and understanding [wink]

My goal is to develop latent abilities, raise knowledge already gained and enact my activities in a practical and versatile way, at professional or social ambit.

### Projects
Currently my day job consume too much of my time, also most of the stuff I'm working cannot be disclosed as defined by contract, so there's not much to show.
